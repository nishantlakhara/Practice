Overview
In this problem, we are given an input array representing different types of fruits and two baskets.

img

We want to collect some fruits from a subarray. However, each basket can only hold one type of fruit. In other words, we can collect at most 2 types of fruits.

Take the picture below as an example:

img

The task is to find out the maximum number of fruits we can collect under this premise.

To start with, we focus on the mathematical part of the problem, this question equals:
Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray that contains at most 2 unique integers. (We will call such subarray a valid subarray for convenience)

Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition
Let's start with the most straightforward method, brute force! That is, to check every subarray and find out the longest valid one.

The steps are simple:

Iterate over all subarrays.
For each subarray, we count the types of fruits it contains. If the subarray has no more than 2 types of fruits, meaning it is valid, we take its length to update the maximum length.
Take the following slides as an example:

Current


Algorithm
Initialize max_picked = 0 to track the maximum number of fruits we can collect.
Iterate over the left index left of subarrays.
For every subarray start at index left, iterate over every index right to fix the end of subarray.
For each subarray (left, right), count the types of fruits it contains.
If there are no more than 2 types, this subarray is valid, we take its length to update max_picked.
Otherwise, if the current subarray is invalid, we move on to the next subarray.
Once we finish the iteration, return max_picked as the maximum number of fruits we can collect.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input array fruits.

Time complexity: O(n
3
 )

We have three nested loops, the first loop for the left index left, the second loop for the right index right, and the third loop for the index currentIndex between left and right.
In each step, we need to add the current fruit to the set basket, which takes constant time.
For each subarray, we need to calculate the size of the basket after the iteration, which also takes constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n
3
 ).
Space complexity: O(n)

During the iteration, we need to count the types of fruits in every subarray and store them in a hash set. In the worst-case scenario, there could be O(n) different types in some subarrays, thus it requires O(n) space complexity.
Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).

Approach 2: Optimized Brute Force
Intuition
There are 3 nested loops in approach 1, so as tons of duplicated calculations. Let's try a better method to reduce the workload!

No inner loop

Let's look at the subarrays generated in every iteration.

For every consecutive subarray, the only difference is that the second subarray has one added fruit, while the rest fruits are the same! Therefore, to get the types of fruits in the second subarray, we just need to add the new fruit to the basket of the first subarray, rather than initializing an empty set and recounting all the fruits again!

img

Early stop
Take a look at the picture below, suppose the iteration of right stops by here, do we need to continue the iteration of right until it reaches the end of the array?

img

No! Since the current window already has more than 2 types of fruits, adding more fruits from the right side does not decrease the number of types, which means that the rest of the windows also have more than 2 types of fruits. Hence, it is time to stop iterating over right, and start over from the next left.

Therefore, we only need two nested loops, the outer loop for the left index left and the inner loop for the right index right. Take the following slides as an example:

Current


Algorithm
Initialize max_picked as 0.
Iterate over left, the left index of the subarray.
For every subarray start at index left, we iterate over every index right to fix the end of subarray, and calculate the types of fruits in this subarray.
If there are no more than 2 types, this subarray is valid, we update max_picked with the length of this subarray.
Otherwise, the current subarray, as well as all the longer subarrays (with the same left index left) are invalid. Move on to the next left index left + 1.
Once we finish the iteration, return max_picked as the maximum number of fruits we can collect.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input array fruits.

Time complexity: O(n
2
 )

Compared with approach 1, we only have two nested loops now.
In each iteration step, we need to add the current fruit to the hash set basket, which takes constant time.
To sum up, the overall time complexity is O(n
2
 )
Space complexity: O(1)

During the iteration, we need to count the number of types in every possible subarray and update the maximum length. Since we used the early stop method, thus the types will never exceed 3. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1)

Approach 3: Sliding Window
Intuition
Can we further reduce the time complexity? The answer is Yes!

Recall how we restart the iteration in approach 2:

If the current fruit at index right makes our window (left, right) have 3 types of fruit, we need to break the iteration over right and start over from index left + 1.

The question is, is this step necessary? Do we need to recalculate the types of fruits from left + 1 again?

If we have found a valid window of size k starting at index left, even though we want to restart at left + 1, there is no need to recalculate the fruit type from left + 1 all to way to right, which represent windows of size no larger than k. We only need to look for windows larger than k!

img

Thus the logic becomes very clear: we let indexes left and right represent the size of the longest valid window we have encountered so far. In further iterations, instead of looking for smaller windows, we just check if the newly added fruit expands the window.

More specifically: we always add fruits from the right side to temporarily increase the window size by 1 (Let's say from k to k + 1), and if the new window is valid, it means that we have managed to find a larger window of size k + 1, great! Otherwise, this means that we haven't encountered a valid window of size k + 1 yet, so we should go back to the previous window size, by removing one fruit from the left side of the window.

Take the following slides as an example:

Current


Algorithm
Start with an empty window with left and right as its left and right index.
We iterate over right and add fruits[right] to this window.
If the number is no larger than 2, meaning that we collect no more than 2 types of fruits, this subarray is valid.
Otherwise, it is not the right time to expand the window and we must keep its size. Since we have added one fruit from the right side, we should remove one fruit from the left side of the window, and increment left by 1.
Once we are done iterating, the difference between left and right stands for the longest valid subarray we encountered, i.e. the maximum number of fruits we can collect.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input array fruits.

Time complexity: O(n)

Both indexes left and right only monotonically increased during the iteration, thus we have at most 2⋅n steps,
At each step, we update the hash set by addition or deletion of one fruit, which takes constant time.
In summary, the overall time complexity is O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

In the worst-case scenario, there might be at most O(n) types of fruits inside the window. Take the picture below as an example. Imagine that we have an array of fruits like the following. (The first half is all one kind of fruit, while the second half is n/2 types of fruits)
img

In the first half of the iteration, the window size is expanded to n/2, i.e. O(n). In the second half of the iteration, since we have to keep the window size, so it will contain all the n/2 types of fruits and end up with O(n) space.

img

Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

Approach 4: Sliding Window II
Intuition
In the previous approach, we keep the window size non-decreasing. However, we might run into cases where the window contains O(n) types of fruits and takes O(n) space.

This can be optimized by making sure that there are always at most 2 types of fruits in the window. After adding a new fruit from the right side right, if the current window has more than 2 types of fruit, we keep removing fruits from the left side left until the current window has only 2 types of fruit. Note that the window size may become smaller than before, thus we cannot rely on left and right to keep track of the maximum number of fruits we can collect. Instead, we can just use a variable max_picked to keep track of the maximum window size we encountered.

img

For the details on the implementation, let's take a look at the following slides.

Current


Algorithm
Initialize max_picked = 0 as the maximum fruits we can collect, and use hash map basket to record the types of fruits in the current window.
Start with an empty window having left = 0 and right = 0 as its left and right index.
We iterate over right and add fruits[right] to this window.
If there are no more than 2 types of fruits, this subarray is valid.
Otherwise, we need to keep removing fruits from the left side until there are only 2 types of fruits in the window.
Then we update max_picked as max(max_picked, right - left + 1).
Once we finish iterating, return max_picked as the maximum number of fruits we can collect.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input array fruits.

Time complexity: O(n)

Similarly, both indexes left and right are only monotonically increasing during the iteration, thus we have at most 2⋅n steps,
At each step, we update the hash set by addition or deletion of one fruit, which takes constant time. Note that the number of additions or deletions does not exceed n.
To sum up, the overall time complexity is O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

We maintain the number of fruit types contained in the window in time. Therefore, at any given time, there are at most 3 types of fruits in the window or the hash map basket.
In summary, the space complexity is O(1).
